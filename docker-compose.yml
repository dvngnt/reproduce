  # mount the host directory cypress and the file cypress.json as
  # volumes within the container
  # this means that:
  #  1. anything that Cypress writes to these folders (e.g., screenshots,
  #     videos) appears also on the Docker host's filesystem
  #  2. any change that the developer applies to Cypress files on the host
  #     machine immediately takes effect within the e2e container (no docker
  #     rebuild required).
